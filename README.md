# lucasew's F-Droid repo

Here is some apps that I can't find anymore and I keep their APKs in my backups.

Some of them are actually abandoned but still might be as useful as the shitload of crapware we find on the Internet.

# Usage
See https://lucasew.github.io/fdroid-repo/fdroid/repo/ for instructions.

# Reminder for my future self
